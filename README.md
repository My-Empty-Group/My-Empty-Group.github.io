# My-Empty-Group.github.io
Hello! This is My-Empty-Group(a.k.a. Team M.E.G.).
### What is My-Empty-Group?
My-Empty-Group works on some random programs. We love Crawl, Minecraft and something else.
### Who are in My-Empty-Group?
There is...Me(projectNoob)! Yes, there's only one man in this organization.
### Why only you?
Because I'm too Noob(?) so I don't have much Pro friends(??).\
This group is for distinction of my different catagory of projects.
### Why a group if only you?
Well...A project made by a man is seemingly poorer than a project made by a team...right?
### Can I join My-Empty-Group?
No. It will no longer be "Empty" if you join.
### So will you cooperate with others?
No __yet__. But I will consider setting up a team after graduating from high school.
### Where did the name come from?
